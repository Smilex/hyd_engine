\subsection{Detailed Description}
Defines a game object. 

An Object is a game object that has a sprite, collision data and a location in the game.

Objects are organized in a hierarchy, so that any object can have a number of children and siblings.

For example, an enemy in the game could consist of a root Object that is the body, and two child objects that are its weapons.

Each of the objects should be able to move independently, but child objects inherit transformation data from their parents. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
